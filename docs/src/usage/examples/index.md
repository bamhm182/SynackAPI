# Examples

These subpages here will provide a couple of very simple examples of how you can use the SynackAPI.
These are going to help you get started, but are definitely not intended to be the best of the best.
I highly encourage you to think about ways you could use the SynackAPI to apply your own logic and make something much better for yourself.
